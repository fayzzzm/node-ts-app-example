## How to Use
- Each folder in `examples/` contains code and a README explaining the concept and how to run the examples.
- Run most examples with `node <filename>` after following the instructions in each README.

## Next Steps
- Work through the remaining concepts above.
- Once fundamentals are complete, move on to application-level architecture and real-world backend design.
